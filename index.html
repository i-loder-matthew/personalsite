<h2>About me</h2>

<img src="/images/haskell-logo.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />

<p>I'm a third year graduate student in lingustics at NYU, working with Chris Barker. I'm interested in semantics and pragmatics, with particular interests in dynamic semantics and discourse anaphora, presupposition projection, and, more recently, the acquisition and typology of logical language like disjunction. </p>
